Xamarin + Fluxx vs React Native and Flutter
----------------------------
Xamarin + Fluxx has similar concepts to React Native and Flutter, but is, well, better.
- Better languages (vs JavaScript/JSX): strongly typed; natively complied performance; reactivity supported directly in core language; cleaner markup + functional syntax than JSX glued on top of JavaScript 
- Better languages (vs Dart): reactivity supported directly in core language; cleaner markup syntax than Dart since Fluxx is designed to be a markup language
- Better tooling: innovative visual UI tooling with immediate feedback on your live app coupled with the world class Visual Studio IDE
- Better native interop: call directly to native platform APIs from a single language; no hand written Objective-C / Java wrappers required
